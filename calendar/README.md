Purpose: 

This is an app developed for people who need to record their schedules.
We offer uesrs to get instant weather information via API while adding appointments, this is to ensure users can easily plan their appointments whilst being aware of the weather. 


Instructions: 

1. Open app
2. Use the arrows to select a date OR:
4. Click on the "+" Symbol
5. Add a task Name
6. Select a Date, Start and Finish time (try 8am - 9:15am - then for the second task 6am-7am, and 1pm-3pm for the last one!)
7. Add an alert time if you want a reminder as well (Mainly for overlapping tasks where an alarm is needed to remind you to switch) 
8. Add a task description 
9. Select "Check Weather" - which will use a weather API - (Note: The Weather forecast only goes as far as 5 days ahead)
10. Click on create task
11. Repeat the above steps twice more with different times set, as we've built in a function to order the tasks, and also allow for overlap whilst prioritising based on "Start Time". 
12. Once back in the main view - Select the Calendar icon and select the date you added the tasks to.
13. Try customising the color!
14. You will see all the tasks you set for that day - Note they are in a list and you can scroll through them as well.
